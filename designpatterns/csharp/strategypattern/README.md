# Requirement
This is a small task that we did in the object-oriented course where we use C#. We are asked to use four different structures (Array, stack, queue and hash table) 
to save the name and e-mail address pairs which are expressed by the [C# struct type](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288471(v=vs.71).aspx). For each of the structure, we are asked to implement the following functions: 
1. Add the value pairs
2. Search by name
3. Search by e-mail
4. Show all entries
5. Sort the entries by name

For this task, I feel it is natural to use the strategy pattern.
